# forms-to-docs
Problem:
It is currently simply too easy for students to use AI to cheat on essays and short answers when allowed to be on a computer. Goguardian can’t even see it. However, reading student handwriting is a straining task, and reading student’s answers on the Google Forms responses tab is awkward, plus even more awkward on a spreadsheet.

Concept:
Have students type their essays or short answers through a locked-down google form. Hopefully deters the blatant cheating. Students’ answers are automatically populated into a google sheet. This “add-on” then automatically transfers each students’ submission into a separate google doc which is placed into a specified folder. This way, you can provide feedback as needed. Then, the “add-on” also includes a button to then share those google docs with those corresponding students once you are done grading.
